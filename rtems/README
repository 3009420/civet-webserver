This is some RTEMS support, it worked for me, no guarantees.

Be sure you have your RTEMS environment set up and working properly and
can run the network demos.  I don't know anything about web serving,
so your best bet is to ask on the Mongoose list.  I can help with your
RTEMS issues.

You'll need to hack the _init.c to setup your network properly.

Then from the parent (mongoose) directory you can try these targets:

- To build the Mongoose library and the trivial sample in this directory,
which will make your RTEMS file system available to a browswer:
prompt% make -f rtems/Makefile

- To build the Mongoose library and the "chat" example application,
assuming you also have SSL installed and working on RTEMS, edit the
Makefile and change MAIN to chat, then follow the above instructions.

prompt% make -f rtems/Makefile

NOTE WELL: I never tried the chat example, I just got it to build.
In particular, you may need to revisit -DPTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER=0
in the Makefile.

- To install the header and library in your project directory:
prompt# make -f rtems/Makefile install
